# Azure Neuromodels Project

## Overview
The Azure Neuromodels Project is designed to develop and deploy neural network models using Azure infrastructure. This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to analyze data and generate insights.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - **data/**: Data files and datasets used for training and testing neural models.
  - **models/**: Neural network model definitions, including architecture and training scripts.
  - **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and visualization of results.
  - **scripts/**: Utility scripts for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and other tasks related to the project.
  - **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

- **terraform/**: Contains the Terraform configurations for deploying the infrastructure.
  - **modules/**: Subfolders for modular Terraform configurations.
    - **compute/**: Resources related to compute instances, such as virtual machines or Azure Functions.
    - **networking/**: Networking resources, including virtual networks, subnets, and network security groups.
    - **storage/**: Storage resources, such as Azure Blob Storage or Azure SQL Database.
  - **main.tf**: The main Terraform configuration file that ties together the various modules and defines the overall infrastructure.
  - **variables.tf**: Declares the input variables for the Terraform configuration.
  - **outputs.tf**: Defines the outputs of the Terraform configuration.
  - **provider.tf**: Specifies the provider configuration for Terraform, indicating that Azure is the target cloud provider.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory and install the required Python packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the Azure infrastructure using Terraform:
   - Navigate to the `terraform` directory.
   - Initialize Terraform:
     ```
     terraform init
     ```
   - Apply the Terraform configuration:
     ```
     terraform apply
     ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data exploration and model training.
- Modify the scripts in the `scripts` directory for data preprocessing and model evaluation as needed.
- Ensure that the required datasets are placed in the `data` directory before running the notebooks or scripts.

## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create robust neural models that can effectively analyze and interpret complex datasets, providing valuable insights and predictions. The project will utilize Azure's cloud capabilities to ensure scalability and efficiency in model training and deployment.
